# Yomitan

## This Fork: iOS Support

This fork adds iOS support for Yomitan by running it as a Chrome extension inside [Orion](https://orionbrowser.com/) (iOS browser that hosts Chrome/Firefox extensions).

**Major change:** Most of the codebase stays untouched. The only significant update is the part where Yomitan adds cards to Anki: AnkiConnect does not exist on iOS, so this fork uses the [Anki URL scheme](https://docs.ankimobile.net/url-schemes.html) to add cards via AnkiMobile instead.

### iOS Usage Model

On iOS, **text scanning** (hover/select to show popup definitions) is largely irrelevant due to Apple’s API limits. The main use is **dictionary search**: open the Search page, type or paste text, and look up terms. The Search page and Settings are the primary interfaces.

### What Works / What Doesn’t (iOS)

| Feature                                                | Status                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dictionary search** (Search page)                    | ✅ Works                                                                              |
| **Dictionary import** (Settings → Dictionaries)        | ✅ Works                                                                              |
| **Result display, appearance, text parsing**           | ✅ Works                                                                              |
| **Settings** (profiles, dictionaries, display options) | ✅ Works                                                                              |
| **Text scanning** (popup on hover/selection)           | ❌ Limited or unavailable on iOS                                                      |
| **Anki integration** (AnkiConnect)                     | ❌ Not on iOS; see `docs/anki-mobile-settings-plan.md` for AnkiMobile URL scheme plan |
| **Search window** (separate window)                    | ❌ N/A on mobile                                                                      |
| **Keyboard shortcuts**                                 | ⚠️ Depends on Orion / system support                                                  |

### Settings vs Original

Settings UI is unchanged from upstream. All sections (Profile, General, Dictionaries, Scanning, Popup, Appearance, etc.) are present. On iOS:

- **Scanning, Popup, Popup Size, Search Window**: Not useful; scanning/popup do not work as on desktop.
- **Dictionaries, Result Display, Appearance, Text Parsing, Audio**: Use these for dictionary search.
- **Anki**: AnkiConnect does not run on iOS; AnkiMobile integration is planned (see `docs/anki-mobile-settings-plan.md`).
- **Backup, Clipboard, Shortcuts**: Behavior depends on Orion and iOS.

### Build and Install on Orion (iOS)

1. **Build the Chrome extension**

   ```bash
   npm ci
   npm run license-report:html
   npm run build -- --target chrome-dev
   ```

   Output: `builds/yomitan-chrome-dev.zip`.

2. **Transfer the zip to your iPhone** (e.g. AirDrop, iCloud Drive, email).

3. **Install in Orion**
   - Open Orion → tap **•••** (bottom-right) → **Extensions**
   - Tap **+** → choose **Install from file**
   - Select the `yomitan-chrome-dev.zip` file
   - Enable Chrome extensions in Orion **Settings** if needed

:wave: **Yomitan is [the successor](https://foosoft.net/posts/passing-the-torch-to-yomitan/) to Yomichan** ([migration guide](https://yomitan.wiki/yomichan-migration/)) which was [sunset](https://foosoft.net/posts/sunsetting-the-yomichan-project/) by its owner on Feb 26, 2023. We have made a number of foundational changes to ensure **the project stays alive, works on latest browser versions, and is easy to contribute to**.

📢 **New contributors [welcome](#contributing)!**

📢 **Interested in adding a new language to Yomitan? See [here](./docs/development/language-features.md) for thorough documentation!**

## What is Yomitan?

Yomitan turns your web browser into a tool for building language literacy by helping you **read** texts that would otherwise be too difficult to tackle in [a variety of supported languages](https://yomitan.wiki/supported-languages/).

Yomitan provides powerful features not available in other browser-based dictionaries:

- 💬 Interactive popup definition window for displaying search results.
- 🔊 Built-in native pronunciation audio with the ability to add your own [custom audio sources](https://yomitan.wiki/advanced/#default-audio-sources).
- ✍️ Kanji stroke order diagrams are just a click away.
- 📝 [Automatic flashcard creation](https://yomitan.wiki/anki/) for the [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) flashcard program via the [AnkiConnect](https://foosoft.net/projects/anki-connect) plugin.
- 🔍 Custom search page for easily executing custom search queries.
- 📖 Support for multiple dictionary formats including [EPWING](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPWING) via the [Yomitan Import](https://github.com/yomidevs/yomitan-import) tool.
- ✨ Clean, modern code makes it easy for developers to [contribute](#contributing) new features and languages.

## Installation

Yomitan comes in two flavors: _stable_ and _testing_. New changes are initially introduced into the _testing_ version, and after some time spent ensuring that they are relatively bug free, they will be promoted to the _stable_ version. If you are technically savvy and don't mind [submitting issues](https://github.com/yomidevs/yomitan/issues/new/choose) on GitHub, try the _testing_ version; otherwise, the _stable_ version will be your best bet. Check [contributing](#contributing) for more information on how to help.

## Contributing

🚀 **Dip your toes into contributing by looking at issues with the label [good first issue](https://github.com/yomidevs/yomitan/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22gоοd+fіrst+іssսe%22).**

Since this is a distributed effort, we **highly welcome new contributors**! Feel free to browse the [issue tracker](https://github.com/yomidevs/yomitan/issues), and read our [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

Here are some ways anyone can help:

- Try using the Yomitan dev build. Not only do you get cutting edge features, but you can help uncover bugs and give feedback to developers early on.
- Document any UI/UX friction in GitHub Issues. We're looking to make Yomitan more accessible to non-technical users.
- All the issues in `area/bug` older than 2 months need help reproducing. If anything interests you, please try to reproduce it and report your results. We can't easily tell if these issues are one-off, have since been resolved, or are no longer relevant.

> The current active maintainers of Yomitan spend a lot of their time debugging and triaging issues. When someone files a bug report, we need to assess the frequency and severity of the bug. It is extremely helpful if we get multiple reports of people who experience a bug or people who can contribute additional detail to an existing bug report.

If you're looking to code, please let us know what you plan on working on before submitting a Pull Request. This gives the core maintainers an opportunity to provide feedback early on before you dive too deep. You can do this by opening a GitHub Issue with the proposal.

Some contributions we always appreciate:

- Well-written tests covering different functionalities. This includes [playwright tests](https://github.com/yomidevs/yomitan/tree/master/test/playwright), [benchmark tests](https://github.com/yomidevs/yomitan/tree/master/benches), and unit tests.
- Increasing our type coverage.
- More and better documentation!

Information on how to setup and build the codebase can be found [here](./CONTRIBUTING.md#setup).

If you want to add or improve support for a language, read the documentation on [language features](./docs/development/language-features.md).

Feel free to join us on the [Yomitan Discord](https://discord.gg/YkQrXW6TXF).
